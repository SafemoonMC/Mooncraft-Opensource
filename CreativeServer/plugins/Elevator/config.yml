# Elevator Combinations:
# Add/Change as many combinations as you want. First Material is the block under your feet.
# Syntax: 'Material:Data, Material:Data' and 'Material:Data'.
# Use 'any' for any block. E.g. 'any, Redstone_block' or 'Quartz_Block, any'.
# If using 'any' as the top block the block at the elevators in the column has to be of the
# same height e.g. if you're standing on a slab then you can only elevate to slabs.
# You can set a custom maxDistance for individual combinations with a third argument e.g:
# - 'Quartz_Block, Redstone_block, 10' <- This means you can only place these 10 blocks apart.
