# Whether multiple item frames next to each other can merge to show one large display
# This allows Map Displays to be displayed on multiple item frames at a larger resolution
# The tiling detection logic poses some overhead on the server, and if unused, can be disabled
enableItemFrameTiling: true

# Whether the Map Display engine is enabled, running in the background to refresh and render maps
# When enabled, the map item tracking may impose a slight overhead
# If no plugin is using map displays, then this can be safely disabled to improve performance
enableMapDisplays: true

# Whether to teleport players to their supposed seat while they hold the sneak button
# This is used on Minecraft 1.16 and later to make sure players stay near their seat,
# when exiting the seat was cancelled.
teleportPlayersToSeat: true

# Whether to force saving to be done synchronously, rather than asynchronously
# If the Asynchronous File I/O in the JVM has a glitch in it, it might cause very large
# corrupt (.yml) files to be generated. On server restart this can cause a loss of data.
# Synchronous saving (such as YAML) may hurt server performance for large files,
# but will prevent these issues from happening.
forceSynchronousSaving: false

# Whether to instrument additional Timings for some of the core BKCommonLib components
# These timings might be useful to identify performance problems, or their causes
# They may cause a slight performance hit, so leave this option disabled unless you need them
debugTimings: false
