# Strictness of how much you wish to enforce
#   lenient - Only prevent game-breaking things or crashes
#   average - Prevent most abusive things (recommended)
#   strict  - Prevent anything non-vanilla

# This prevents FAWE brush NBT on items. It stops users from giving
# out FAWE brush items which may trick others into accidentally WorldEdit'ing

# When checking packets, by default, Panilla will check any inventory (player, chest, etc...)
# Setting this to true will make Panilla only check player inventories

# This can help with ensuring custom GUI's in plugins don't get flagged
# This may also marginally improve performance

# Keep in mind some NBT tags vary between Minecraft versions

# Override Minecraft's max enchantment levels
# Useful if you want to manually set a max enchantment level for specific enchantments

# This is to prevent crash items which have an excessive
# amount of NBT keys.

# If you have plugins which use an excessive amount of

# Generally, you should never have to touch this.
