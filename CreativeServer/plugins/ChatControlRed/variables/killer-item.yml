# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ChatControl supports dynamic, high performance variables you create! They can be used across
# the plugin, for example in formatting your chat or death messages. Currently, the folder
# variables/ stores all custom variables in each separate yml file.
#
# Variables can not only be used to display information, but because you can write your own full
# code in JavaScript to display them, they can also do whatever you would wish for your
# players/server, such as sneaking in code to send sounds or spawn monsters.
#
# Coding this variable requires a little bit of JavaScript knowledge, see the link below.
#
# For documentation and help, please see this link:

# Where should this variable be used?
#
# FORMAT = used in your formats with {syntax}, players cannot use it
# MESSAGE = players can use it with [syntax] in their chat messages
Type: message

# The key we look for in the chat surrounded by [] brackets, example:
# chat message: "Hello everyone, I have an [item] in my hand" if your key is equal to "item"
Key: killer_item

# The value the key will be replaced to. This uses JavaScript.
Value: |-
    
    // A valid JavaScript code follows below. You can use the "player" variable to get
    // Bukkit's player instance.

    function itemDisplayName() {
        var item = player.getInventory().getItemInHand();
    
        // Change these three variables to alter the color of the killer item and what name
        // shall we use if killer had no item
        var textColor = '&a';
        var bracketColor = '&f';
        var airName = 'fists';
    
        if (item.hasItemMeta() && item.getItemMeta().hasDisplayName()) {
            var itemName = player.getInventory().getItemInHand().getItemMeta().getDisplayName();
    
            return bracketColor + '[' + textColor + itemName + bracketColor + ']';

            var itemDefaultName = wordUtils.capitalizeFully(itemMaterial.contains("AIR") ? airName : itemMaterial.replaceAll('_', ' '));
