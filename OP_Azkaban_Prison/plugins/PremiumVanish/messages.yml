# Some messages allow different, unique variables too
#
# NOTE: You can get WAY more placeholders by installing PlaceholderAPI or MVdWPlaceholderAPI
#
# You can also make any message dependent on a player's group by adding 'PerGroup' in front of the message:
# PerGroupNoPermission:
#   Admin: 'What, this should not happen you are the Admin!'
#   Player: 'You have like no permissions anyway'
#   Silence: ''
#   Default: 'Access denied.'
#
# You can start a message with [JSON] to send JSON text directly.
# Example: '[JSON]{"text":"Welcome %p%","color":"yellow"}'
#
# Empty messages will not be sent.
# Using \n starts a new line.
#
# Important:
# You must double single quotes if you want to use them inside a message.
# You must NOT use any tab characters inside this file (indent key) otherwise YAML will spam your console with errors!
# !! If there are errors in the console after editing this file paste it into an online YAML parser to see if
# there are any YAML syntax errors !!
