  pool-settings:
    # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
    # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
    #   connections to the database backend.
    # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
    #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
    maximum-pool-size: 10
    # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
    # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
    #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
    #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
    minimum-idle: 10
    # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
    # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
    #   connection time limit.
    maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes
    # This setting controls how frequently the pool will 'ping' a connection in order to prevent it
    # from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure, measured in milliseconds.
    # - The value should be less than maximum-lifetime and greater than 30000 (30 seconds).
    # - Setting the value to zero will disable the keepalive functionality.
    keepalive-time: 0
    # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
    # connection from the pool, before timing out.
    connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
    # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.
    #
    # You can also use this section to disable SSL connections, by uncommenting the 'useSSL' and
    # 'verifyServerCertificate' options below.
    properties:
      useUnicode: true
      characterEncoding: utf8
