# What should values be called?
# In the default value, the ajtr_stats_wins_nocache board will have a name of "wins" to be displayed on signs

# How often should we refresh the stats of online players?

# Should this server update player stats?
#  If disabled, stats will not be recorded to the database, and ajleaderboards will basically only read from it.
#  This can be useful if you have a lobby where you want to display leaderboards, but want to make sure anything in the lobby
#   doesnt override the stats from other servers

# You should probably keep this disabled unless you know what you are doing or are told to turn it on.

# Should we block the server when loading placeholders?
# If this is true, it can cause some lag when the placeholders first get loaded, but that only happens once
#  (until the server restarts again)
# Usually this isnt an issue, but if you see lag from ajLeaderboards and you dont have head blocks, maybe disable this

# Should we print some more stuff about the internals of fetching?
# You really only need to use this if the dev asks for it.
