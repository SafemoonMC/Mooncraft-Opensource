# Categories are a way of grouping up quests.
# When a player uses /quests, a menu of categories will be presented to them.
# When a player clicks ona category, a list of quests under that category will show.
# If categories are disabled, all quests will be shown under one big GUI.
# Players can access specific categories by command using /quests c [category].
# If a quest does not have a category, it will not be shown.
