# -- Player reset permission nodes --
#Players (if they have the permission jetsprisonmines.user.reset can reset mines)
#Give them a permission underneath in order to set a timed delay on how often they can do a reset, you can create more permissions
#Tax permission nodes must be specified here:
reset_permission_nodes:
  - "jetsprisoncells.user.reset.30" #If they have this permission node, they will be able to do the /mine reset command every 30 seconds
  - "jetsprisoncells.user.reset.60" #If they have this permission node, they will be able to do the /mine reset command every 60 seconds
  - "jetsprisoncells.user.reset.120" #If they have this permission node, they will be able to do the /mine reset command every 120 seconds

#When timed resets are use, should we reset the mine if it's not been mined at all?
reset_mine_if_full: false #false = it wont reset, true = it will reset despite being full already

#Whether when a mine resets, only missing blocks should be reset? This can help with performance. This option is only applied for percentage resets. This option should no longer be used, as checking if a block is air or not is equally CPU intesnive
#Using the reset command will replace all blocks still
