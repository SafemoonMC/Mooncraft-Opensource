# Full color code support and some variables
# Keep in mind that variables wont work for some lines, when it will for anothers :)
# Just keep them where there are now and everything will be ok :)
# Some lines can have global variables set. For player who will be effected. In example /heal Zrips then Zrips data will be used
# [serverName] to show server name
# [playerName] to show target player name
# [playerDisplayName] to show target player display name
# [lvl] to show target player level
# [exp] to show target player total exp
# [hp] to show target player health
# [maxHp] to show target player max health
# [hunger] to show target player hunger level
# [gameMode] to show target player gamemode
# [prefix] to show target player prefix if possible
# [suffix] to show target player suffix if possible
# Sender is console or player who performs command. In example Zrips performs /heal Zhax then Zrips data will be used
# [senderName] to show Sender player name
# [senderDisplayName] to show Sender player display name
# [senderLvl] to show Sender player level
# [senderExp] to show Sender player total exp
# [senderHp] to show Sender player health
# [senderMaxHp] to show Sender player max health
# [senderHunger] to show Sender player hunger level
# [senderGameMode] to show Sender player gamemode
# [senderPrefix] to show Sender player prefix if possible
# [senderSuffix] to show Sender player suffix if possible
# Source is player which is being used for extra info. In example Zrips performs /tp Zhax Zrips then Zhax data will be used as its location is being taken for new player location
# [sourceName] to show source player name
# [sourceDisplayName] to show source player display name
# [sourceLvl] to show source player level
# [sourceExp] to show source player total exp
# [sourceHp] to show source player health

# ***********************************************
# Some lines supports option to send them to custom places, like action bar, title, sub title or even create JSON/clickable messages
# If line starts with !toast! then player will get toast message (advancement popup, only 1.12 and up). Some extra variables can be used to define type and icon. example: !toast! -t:goal -icon:paper Hello world!
# If line starts with !actionbar! then player will get action bar message defined after this variable
# If line starts with !actionbar:[seconds]! then player will get action bar message for defined amount of time
# If line starts with !broadcast! then everyone will receive message. You can add extra !toast! !actionbar! or !title! to send message for everyone to specific place, in example !broadcast!!title!
# If line starts with !customtext:[cTextName]! then custom text will be taken by name provided and shown for player. In case its used after !broadcast! then everyone who is online will get this custom text message
# If line starts with !title! then player will get title message defined after this variable, in addition it can contain !subtitle! which will add subtitle message
# If line starts with !bosbar:[name]-[timer]! then player will get bossbar message defined after this variable, in addition you can define how long this message will be visible. You need to define bossbar name which can be anything you want, but lines with same name will override each other to prevent stacking
# To include clickable messages: <T>Text</T><H>Hover text</H><C>command</C><SC>Suggested text</SC>
# <T> and </T> required, other is optional
# Use /n to break line
# To have more than one JSON message use <Next>
# <C> performs command as a player who clicked
# <CC> performs command from console once
# <CCI> performs command from console every time player clicks text
# <URL> includes url
# 
# 
# 
# ATTENTION! As of 9.0.0.0 CMI version some of the locale lines got moved to CMILib file. This is to centralize some of most used ones across multiple plugins.
# After you update locale in CMILib file perform /CMIL RELOAD command for changes to take effect

      explanation:
      - PlaceHolderAPI is supported for progression and text it self
      - Time is defined in regular way, like 1s is one second and 1m is one minute.
        This will determine for how long to keep bar shown for player before automatically
        hiding
      - nameOfBar is option and when defining same one, then current bar will update
        with new information
      - 'colors can be: red, green, pink, purple, white, yellow'
      - max and current values determines bar fillup, PlaceHolderAPI variables can
        be used for dynamic updates
      - 'Examples:'
      - /cmi bossbar Zrips BossBarTitle
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -t:1s -p:%server_max_players%/%server_online% -n:testbar
        -c:red &2Title of bar %server_online%/%server_max_players% &7%cmi_user_name%
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -p:+1 -n:testbar - will add one percent towards current
        progresion bar by name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -p:-1 -n:testbar - will take out one percent from current
        progresion bar by name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -s:10 -n:testbar - will set bossbar style to 10 segments
        by bar name
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -sec:5 - will count for 5 seconds from 0 to 5
      - /cmi bossbarmsg all -sec:-5 - will count for 5 seconds from 5 to 0
