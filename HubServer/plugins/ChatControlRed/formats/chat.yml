#                                  Welcome to formats configuration
# !-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
#
#   A format renders and customizes a message send to player(s). It can be used across our plugin 
#   in many places, such as in channels, rules, commands etc.
#
#   Remember, you can remove or edit all parts below, and create your own ones! A lot options
#   are optional, that means you do not have to specify them at all.
#
#   Each format consists of parts such as "delete-chat" below. Each part can show different hover
#   events etc. or be hidden if sender/recipient has a certain permission, and more.
#
#   All format options except "Message" are optional. If you don't need those, you can remove it.
#
#   Options for each format part:
#   - Message: A simple string what will be shown in the chat. 
#   - Sender_Permission: What permission must the message sender have for this part to show.
#   - Receiver_Permission: Only show this part to the receivers having this permission.
#   - Sender_Condition: JavaScript condition that must return true for sender (use "player" to get
#                       the Player instance from Spigot) for this part to show.
#   - Receiver_Condition: Similar to Sender_Condition but the script will evaluate against each 
#                         receiver and only show this part to those for which condition is true.
#   - Hover: One line or a list of tooltip to show when hovering over this part with your mouse.
#   - Hover_Item: JavaScript with "player" instance as variable that must return a valid ItemStack
#                 to show when hovering over this part (e.g. "player.getItemInHand()")
#   - Open_Url: A one-line message representing a website to open which clicking on this part. 
#   - Suggest_Command: A one-line message that be suggested as command when clicked on this part.
#   - Run_Command: One command (Minecraft only supports one) that will run upon clicking on part.
#   - Insertion: The text to insert into the chat when this component
#                (and child components) are clicked while pressing the shift key.
#   - Inherit: (Limited) A name of another format from another file to import and use.
#   - Inherit_Part: (Limited) A name of another part from this file to import and use.
#   - Gradient: <from> - <to> (such as RED - GOLD or #123456 - #123456) Gradients for MC 1.16+.

# The default chat format used by chat formatting or in the "standard" channel.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The parts of this format.
Parts:

  # Show the [X] button only visible to people having permission on 'Receiver_Permission'
  # that enables you to remove chat messages by clicking on them!
  # PS: They are still saved to log and can be viewed with "/chc log".
  # TIP: Give yourself chatcontrol.bypass.spamkick to prevent being kicked when removing mass messages.
  delete-chat:
    Message: '&8[&4✖&8] &f'
    Receiver_Permission: chatcontrol.removemessages
    Hover:
    - '&cRemove this message from chat for all players.'
    Run_Command: /{label} internal remove {message_uuid}

  # Finally, pull the regular player prefix from your permissions plugin using Vault.
  # The + at the end of the variable automatically inserts a space if player has prefix.
  # E.g. "admin" turns into "admin ". If there's no prefix, you won't end with a trailing space.
  prefix:
    Message: '{player_prefix}'
  tag:
    Message: '{deluxetags_tag}'

  # Display a typical player name to players with the given permission. change {player_name} 
  # to {player_nick} to show nick instead. We'll revert to show normal name if player has no nick.
  # To display a name in rainbow colors, uncomment "Gradient". This requires MC 1.16+
  player-name:
    Message: '{luckperms_suffix_element_highest}{player_nick}&7: '

  # And finally, show the message the player has typed out, prepending it with player's
  # suffix from your permission plugin. If player has custom '/chc color', we append it
  # after the suffix. Even if you remove the suffix, custom colors will still be appended. 
  message:
    Message: '{luckperms_suffix_element_lowest}{message}'
  punish-player:
    Message: '&8 [&c✓&8]'
    Receiver_Permission: chatcontrol.punishplayer
    Hover:
    - '&eClick to open moderator punishment GUI'
    Run_Command: /punish {player_name}
