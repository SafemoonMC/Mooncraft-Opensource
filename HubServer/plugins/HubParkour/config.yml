  #Specifies the type of pressure plates that the plugin uses. Values CANNOT be the same. The plugin will disable itself
  #if an invalid or duplicate value is detected. Modify with caution.
  #Valid values: Any type of pressure plate listed in the Spigot API Materials Enum. Google "Spigot API Material" to see a full list.
  #Obviously if this is being used on a legacy server (anything between 1.8-1.12 I consider to be legacy) not all of the pressure
  #plates in the newer Spigot API are in the older versions, so you need to plan accordingly. If you are in a legacy version, these values
  #will register as invalid at first. You must change these values.
  #If you change these values when a parkour is already set up, the plugin will automatically replace the pressure
  #plates upon restarting the server.
